Part 2: Database Design 

Based on the requirements below, design a database schema. Note: These requirements are intentionally incomplete - you should identify what's missing.

Given Requirements:
Companies can have multiple warehouses
Products can be stored in multiple warehouses with different quantities
Track when inventory levels change
Suppliers provide products to companies
Some products might be "bundles" containing other products

Your Tasks:
Design Schema: Create tables with columns, data types, and relationships
Identify Gaps: List questions you'd ask the product team about missing requirements
Explain Decisions: Justify your design choices (indexes, constraints, etc.)
Format: Use any notation (SQL DDL, ERD, text description, etc.)
