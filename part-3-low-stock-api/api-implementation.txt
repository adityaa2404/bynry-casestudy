Part 3: API Implementation (35 minutes)
Implement an endpoint that returns low-stock alerts for a company.
Business Rules (discovered through previous questions):
Low stock threshold varies by product type
Only alert for products with recent sales activity
Must handle multiple warehouses per company
Include supplier information for reordering
Endpoint Specification:
GET /api/companies/{company_id}/alerts/low-stock

Expected Response Format:
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "product_id": 123,
      "product_name": "Widget A",
      "sku": "WID-001",
      "warehouse_id": 456,
      "warehouse_name": "Main Warehouse",
      "current_stock": 5,
      "threshold": 20,
      "days_until_stockout": 12,
      "supplier": {
        "id": 789,
        "name": "Supplier Corp",
        "contact_email": "orders@supplier.com"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_alerts": 1
}

Tasks:
Write Implementation: Use any language/framework (Python/Flask, Node.js/Express, etc.)
Handle Edge Cases: Consider what could go wrong
Explain Approach: Add comments explaining your logic
