Part 1: Code Review & Debugging (30 minutes)
A previous intern wrote this API endpoint for adding new products. Something is wrong - the code compiles but doesn't work as expected in production.



@app.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.json
    
    # Create new product
    product = Product(
        name=data['name'],
        sku=data['sku'],
        price=data['price'],
        warehouse_id=data['warehouse_id']
    )
    
    db.session.add(product)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Update inventory count
    inventory = Inventory(
        product_id=product.id,
        warehouse_id=data['warehouse_id'],
        quantity=data['initial_quantity']
    )
    
    db.session.add(inventory)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return {"message": "Product created", "product_id": product.id}


Your Tasks:
Identify Issues: List all problems you see with this code (technical and business logic)
Explain Impact: For each issue, explain what could go wrong in production
Provide Fixes: Write the corrected version with explanations
Additional Context (you may need to ask for more):
Products can exist in multiple warehouses
SKUs must be unique across the platform
Price can be decimal values
Some fields might be optional
